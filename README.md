# Homework1
Upon receiving the HTML and CSS of a website, I was tasked with taking steps to make sure its accessibility was on par with what would be expected of a modern website.  This included making numerous changes to both the HTML and the CSS to ensure readability without changing the external appearance of the webpage.  Below are the steps I took to complete this task.

* Added a concise, informative title in the header
* Fixed the broken link in the nav bar
* Added semantic HTML to make the HTML read easier and the flow more understandable
* Updated the CSS to reflect the addition of the semantic elements in the HTML
* Added notes to the HTML distinguishing individual parts of the website for greater readability
* Added ALT tags to all images to increase accessibility
* Corrected out of sequence h tags to improve readability
* Organized CSS by grouping similar elements together
* Added notes to CSS to improve readability.

It is my hope that through these changes, not only is the code easier to read, but the website is more accessible to those with different needs.# Homework1
